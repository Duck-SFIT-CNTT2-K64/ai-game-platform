# Robot Pathfinding Game (AI)

An educational AI game that simulates the robot pathfinding problem,
allowing users to visualize and compare classical search algorithms
in Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a robot navigates through a maze-like
environment to reach a target position.  
The main goal is to help students understand and compare different
AI search algorithms through direct visualization.

The robot moves in a 2D grid environment containing:
- Walls
- Bombs (reduce robot lives)
- Start position
- Goal position

The robot wins if it reaches the goal with at least one remaining life.

## AI Algorithms

The following classical AI search algorithms are implemented and compared:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Best First Search
- A* Search

## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- JavaFX
- Maven

## Features

- Grid-based maze environment
- Step-by-step visualization of search algorithms
- Robot animation during pathfinding
- Comparison of algorithms based on:
  - Path length
  - Number of explored nodes
  - Remaining lives

## Project Status

- Phase 1: Project initialization and architecture setup
